## 📈 Scalable Stock Price Prediction Framework

This project presents a scalable and integrated framework for **stock price prediction** using **NoSQL databases, distributed computing, time series analysis, and deep learning**.

### 🔍 Overview

Stock price prediction is inherently challenging due to market volatility and complex temporal dynamics. This project combines **MongoDB**, **Apache Spark**, **classical time series models**, and **deep learning (LSTM)** to efficiently process large-scale historical stock data and improve predictive performance.

### 🏗️ Architecture & Technologies

* **MongoDB (NoSQL):** Flexible and scalable storage for large volumes of historical stock data
* **Apache Spark:** Distributed data preprocessing and large-scale computation
* **Time Series Models:** Implemented using `statsmodels` (e.g. ARIMA/SARIMA) to capture temporal structure
* **Deep Learning:** LSTM networks built with **TensorFlow** to model complex sequential dependencies

### ⚙️ Key Features

* Distributed data processing for scalability and performance
* Hybrid modeling approach combining statistical and deep learning methods
* End-to-end pipeline from data ingestion to forecasting
* Comparative analysis between traditional time series and deep learning models

### 📊 Results

Time series and LSTM models demonstrate strong capability in capturing temporal dependencies, with **deep learning models outperforming traditional machine learning approaches** in predictive accuracy.

### 🚀 Use Cases

* Financial time series forecasting
* Large-scale market data analysis
* Research and experimentation with hybrid predictive models
